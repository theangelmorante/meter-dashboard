# ION Energy Solutions Assessment Rules

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vitest.
- **Project Goal**: Process raw meter readings into hourly consumption and display them in a dashboard.
- **Core Logic**: `lib/processor.ts` must be a pure function. No React dependencies here.
- **Business Rules**:
    1. Delta: current - previous volume.
    2. Gaps: Distribute consumption evenly across missing hours and flag as `gap_estimated`.
    3. Counter Reset: If current < previous, delta = current. Flag as `counter_reset`.
- **UI Requirements**:
    - Fleet Overview: Table/Cards with ID, latest reading, total consumption, and status (active if reported in last 2h).
    - Detail View: Hourly chart (use Recharts) and data table.
- **Code Style**: 
    - Use functional components and hooks.
    - Clean, documented TypeScript interfaces.
    - English only for code and comments.
